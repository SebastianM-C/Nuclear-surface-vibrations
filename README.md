# Fingerprints of global classical phase-space structure in quantum spectra

This code reproduces the results of the following article:
**Fingerprints of global classical phase-space structure in quantum spectra**,
*S. Micluta-Campeanu, M.C. Raportaru, A.I. Nicolin, V. Baran*,
Rom. Rep. Phys. **70**, 105 (2018)

The code is organized in two parts, corresponding to the simulations for
classical and quantum chaos.
